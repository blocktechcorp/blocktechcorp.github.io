<h1 id="Trump_Voted_Winner_of_10th_GOP_Presidential_Debate_by_One_Vote"><a href="#Trump_Voted_Winner_of_10th_GOP_Presidential_Debate_by_One_Vote" class="headerlink" title="Trump Voted Winner of 10th GOP Presidential Debate by One Vote"></a>Trump Voted Winner of 10th GOP Presidential Debate by One Vote</h1><p>NEW YORK — Blockchain Tech Corp. conducted a straw poll of Thursday night’s CNN GOP Presidential Debate held at New York’s Metropolitan Republican Club in a post-debate watch party. Trump edged out Cruz by just one vote, and Rubio was not far behind in what was an almost three-way tied debate.</p>
<p>The voting technology employed to conduct the straw poll utilizes the security features of the “blockchain” — the groundbreaking new technology underlying the digital currency Bitcoin. This innovation enables the company to conduct secure, tamper resistant elections by using the blockchain as a high-tech audit trail to ensure voting records are transparently verifiable and all votes are unique.</p>
<p>The poll was a follow up to earlier polls held at the club also conducted by Blockchain Apparatus at each of the previous GOP debates. Executives with Blockchain Technologies Corporation say the company is currently servicing labor Union elections and will continue to showcase its ground breaking voting technology throughout the 2016 election cycle.</p>
<p>Participants in the poll were asked: “who do you think won tonight’s debate?” Out of 42 participants, Trump received the most votes with 14, but Cruz came in second place in a virtual tie with 13 votes. Rubio came close to making it a three-way tie and brought in 9 votes.</p>
<p>Below are the official results from the CNN GOP Presidential Debate straw poll conducted at the New York Metropolitan Republican Club:</p>
<p>Donald Trump 14<br>Ted Cruz 13<br>Marco Rubio 9<br>John Kasich 5<br>Ben Carson 1</p>
<p>Blockchain Technologies Corp. is a part of Global Arena Holding Inc (GAHC: OTC US). They are working to bring modern technology and transparency to the election process. The company has filed a non-provisional utility patent titled ‘System and Method For Securely Receiving And Counting Votes In An Election’ – Application #14820530.</p>

<h1 id="2016_Iowa_Caucus_Results_Forever_Documented_on_Blockchain"><a href="#2016_Iowa_Caucus_Results_Forever_Documented_on_Blockchain" class="headerlink" title="2016 Iowa Caucus Results Forever Documented on Blockchain"></a>2016 Iowa Caucus Results Forever Documented on Blockchain</h1><p>2016 Iowa Caucus Results Forever Documented on Blockchain<br>Behind the intense politics of the 2016 Iowa Caucuses was a groundbreaking tech story. Microsoft may have dominated headlines with their voting app provided to the Democratic and Republican parties, but unknown to most, another tech company made history.</p>
<p>Blockchain Technologies Corp., working with the Rand Paul campaign, has recorded the raw reporting results of Iowa caucus precinct captains onto the blockchain, the world’s most secure method of information safekeeping. Results were reported to IowaCaucus.net and the links to the official blockchain records are available there as well. This is the first time that government election results were recorded onto the blockchain and it signifies a new paradigm in elections transparency.</p>
<p>The blockchain is the open source peer to peer internet database with publicly viewable, signed-and-timestamped records that cannot be manipulated, modified, or deleted once entered. In other words, it is the perfect tool to transparently record votes in a tamper-proof way.</p>
<p>The voting records recorded on the blockchain the day of the election cannot be manipulated later if and when an audit or recount is ordered. The permanent, timestamped blockchain records ensure any information added after the election would stand out as such. Auditors would have no difficulty determining if additional records were added later and inquire as to why.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate reality that ballot boxes can get stuffed and other forms of electronic records can be doctored; and this diminishes the confidence in elections on which democracy relies. Fraud of this kind is <em>mathematically next to impossible</em> under blockchain–based vote tallying. The blockchain will ensure 100% confidence in the way votes are recorded and tallied.</p>
<p>The 2016 Iowa Caucuses were, inarguably, a historic moment. The Democratic party was <em>split by less than 1%!</em> In such a close race, blockchain-based voting records can eliminate any questions of accuracy. It is easy to imagine a future where all election results are posted onto the blockchain. Blockchain Technologies Corp. is privileged to usher in this brave new era of democracy.</p>
<p>Blockchain Technologies Corp. is a tech startup focusing on creating solutions for real world issues using blockchain technology, located in New York, NY. The product created to record election results onto the blockchain is called <a href="http://votewatcher.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Votewatcher.com</a>.

<h1 id="Ted_Cruz_Voted_Winner_of_6th_GOP_Presidential_Debate_with_Just_One_More_Vote_Than_Trump"><a href="#Ted_Cruz_Voted_Winner_of_6th_GOP_Presidential_Debate_with_Just_One_More_Vote_Than_Trump" class="headerlink" title="Ted Cruz Voted Winner of 6th GOP Presidential Debate with Just One More Vote Than Trump"></a>Ted Cruz Voted Winner of 6th GOP Presidential Debate with Just One More Vote Than Trump</h1><p>NEW YORK — Blockchain Tech Corp. conducted a straw poll of Thursday night’s Fox Business GOP Presidential Debate held at New York’s Metropolitan Republican Club in a post-debate watch party. Cruz and Trump were virtually tied, with 18 and 17 votes respectively.</p>
<p>The voting technology employed utilizes the security features of the “blockchain” — the groundbreaking new technology underlying the digital currency Bitcoin. This innovation enables the company to conduct secure, tamper resistant elections by using the blockchain as a high-tech audit trail to ensure voting records are transparently verifiable and all votes are unique.</p>
<p>“The blockchain enables so many great things that were never before possible. While many people are focused on financial applications, we are bringing the security and transparency it enables into the election process.” said Nick Spanos, CEO of Blockchain Technologies Corp.</p>
<p>The poll was a follow up to earlier polls held at the club also conducted by Blockchain Apparatus at each of the previous GOP debates. Executives with Blockchain Technologies Corporation say the company is currently servicing labor Union elections and will continue to showcase its ground breaking voting technology throughout the 2016 election cycle.</p>
<p>Participants in the poll were asked: “who do you think won tonight’s debate?” Out of 53 participants, Cruz received the most votes with 18, Trump was just shy of a tie with 17 votes, and Rubio pulled in 11 votes.</p>
<p>Below are the official results from Fox Business GOP Presidential Debate straw poll conducted at the New York Metropolitan Republican Club:</p>
<p>Ted Cruz 18<br>Donald J. Trump 17<br>Marco Rubio 11<br>John Kasich 4<br>Chris Christie 2<br>Jeb Bush 1<br>Ben Carson 0</p>
<p>Blockchain Technologies Corp. is a part of Global Arena Holding Inc (GAHC: OTC US). They are working to bring modern technology and transparency to the election process. The company has filed a non-provisional utility patent titled ‘System and Method For Securely Receiving And Counting Votes In An Election’ – Application #14820530.</p>
