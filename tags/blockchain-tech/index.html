<h1 id="Ted_Cruz_Voted_Winner_of_7th_GOP_Presidential_Debate"><a href="#Ted_Cruz_Voted_Winner_of_7th_GOP_Presidential_Debate" class="headerlink" title="Ted Cruz Voted Winner of 7th GOP Presidential Debate"></a>Ted Cruz Voted Winner of 7th GOP Presidential Debate</h1><p>NEW YORK — Blockchain Tech Corp. conducted a straw poll of Thursday night’s Fox News GOP Presidential Debate held at New York’s Metropolitan Republican Club in a post-debate watch party. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were the clear crowd favorites in the absence of previously high scoring candidate Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The voting technology employed to conduct the straw poll utilizes the security features of the “blockchain” — the groundbreaking new technology underlying the digital currency Bitcoin. This innovation enables the company to conduct secure, tamper resistant elections by using the blockchain as a high-tech audit trail to ensure voting records are transparently verifiable and all votes are unique.</p>
<p>The poll was a follow up to earlier polls held at the club also conducted by Blockchain Apparatus at each of the previous GOP debates. Executives with Blockchain Technologies Corporation say the company is currently servicing labor Union elections and will continue to showcase its ground breaking voting technology throughout the 2016 election cycle.</p>
<p>Participants in the poll were asked: “who do you think won tonight’s debate?” Out of 50 participants, Cruz received the most votes with 20, Rubio came in second with 13 votes.</p>
<p>Below are the official results from Fox Business GOP Presidential Debate straw poll conducted at the New York Metropolitan Republican Club:</p>
<p>Ted Cruz 20<br>Marco Rubio 13<br>Jeb Bush 7<br>Chris Christie 6<br>Rand Paul 3<br>John Kasich 1<br>Ben Carson 0</p>
<p>Blockchain Technologies Corp. is a part of Global Arena Holding Inc (GAHC: OTC US). They are working to bring modern technology and transparency to the election process. The company has filed a non-provisional utility patent titled ‘System and Method For Securely Receiving And Counting Votes In An Election’ – Application #14820530.</p>

<p>The voting technology employed utilizes the security features of the “blockchain” — the groundbreaking new technology underlying the digital currency Bitcoin. This innovation enables the company to conduct secure, tamper resistant elections by using the blockchain as a high-tech audit trail to ensure voting records are transparently verifiable and all votes are unique.</p>
<p>“The blockchain enables so many great things that were never before possible. While many people are focused on financial applications, we are bringing the security and transparency it enables into the election process.” said Nick Spanos, CEO of Blockchain Technologies Corp.</p>
<p>The poll was a follow up to earlier polls held at the club also conducted by Blockchain Apparatus at each of the previous GOP debates. Executives with Blockchain Technologies Corporation say the company is currently servicing labor Union elections and will continue to showcase its ground breaking voting technology throughout the 2016 election cycle.</p>
<p>Participants in the poll were asked: “who do you think won tonight’s debate?” Out of 53 participants, Cruz received the most votes with 18, Trump was just shy of a tie with 17 votes, and Rubio pulled in 11 votes.</p>

The poll was conducted at a watch party held at New York’s Metropolitan Republican Club. Ted Cruz had the most support following the debate, followed by Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The voting technology employed utilizes the blockchain — the technology underlying the security of the digital currency Bitcoin. This allows the company to conduct secure, tamper resistant elections by using the blockchain as a high-tech audit trail to ensure voting records are transparently verifiable and all votes are unique.</p>
<p>Speaking on an earlier straw poll conducted by Blockchain Tech Corp., the manager of the Metropolitan Club, Jeff Goolsby, said:</p>
<p>“I think what they bring to the voting process is the future of free and open elections.”</p>
<p>Executives with Blockchain Technologies Corporation say the company will continue to showcase its voting technology throughout the 2016 election cycle.</p>
<p>Participants in the poll were asked: “who do you think won tonight’s debate?” Out of 86 potential voters, the clear winner was Ted Cruz with 33 votes; Donald Trump, the favorite from the previous GOP debate, only received 19 votes this time.</p>
<p>Below are the official results from Blockchain Tech Corp.’s 5th GOP Presidential Debate Straw Poll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ted Cruz - 33</li>
<li>Donald Trump - 19</li>
<li>Marco Rubio - 13</li>
<li>Chris Christie - 8</li>
<li>Rand Paul - 7</li>
<li>Carly Fiorina - 4</li>
<li>Jeb Bush - 1</li>
